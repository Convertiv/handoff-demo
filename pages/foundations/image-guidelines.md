## Image Use Guidelines

Consistent, intentional use of imagery helps strengthen our brand identity, clarify meaning, and create an inclusive, accessible experience for all users. Please follow these guidelines when working with images in your designs.

### Choosing Images

- Use high-quality, relevant images that align with the message and brand values.
- Avoid generic stock photos or images that feel out of place or inauthentic.
- Opt for original or officially branded images whenever possible.

### Sizing & Resolution

- Always export and use images at appropriate resolutions for their context (e.g., @2x or @3x for high-DPI displays).
- Avoid using large images where small images will suffice to keep load times fast.
- Crop and scale images intentionally to focus on the desired content.

### File Types

- Use SVGs for simple illustrations, icons, and logos whenever possible for crisp, scalable graphics.
- Use optimized PNG or JPEG for photographs or complex illustrations.
- For transparency, use PNG (or SVG) rather than GIF.
- Consider WebP format when browser support and tools permit, for photos and graphics.

### Accessibility

- Provide descriptive `alt` text that conveys the content and purpose of the image.
- Avoid using images as the only means of conveying information—supplement with text when appropriate.
- Ensure sufficient contrast in images with overlaid text.

### Image Placement

- Use a consistent style and placement throughout products and assets.
- Maintain sufficient spacing between images and other elements.
- Use images to support—not distract from—content.

### Do’s

- **Do** use images to clarify concepts or make content more engaging.
- **Do** credit image sources where required.
- **Do** use branding elements (like logo or brand patterns) as appropriate.
- **Do** crop images for clarity and focus.

### Don’ts

- **Don’t** stretch, warp, or distort images.
- **Don’t** place images on busy or low-contrast backgrounds that make them hard to see.
- **Don’t** use copyrighted images without proper rights and attribution.
- **Don’t** use decorative images that add no value to the content.

### Examples

Below are real-world placeholder examples demonstrating correct and incorrect image use:

#### Correct Usage

![Crisp, properly proportioned, relevant placeholder image](https://picsum.photos/400/200)

This image uses the right dimensions, proportions, and is contextually relevant.

![User avatar sample](https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/65.jpg)

A clear, correctly cropped avatar image ensures user identity is recognizable.

![Logo in SVG format (placeholder)](https://placehold.co/100x40?text=Logo+SVG)

Vector logos scale nicely and always appear crisp.

#### Incorrect Usage

![Stretched image example](https://picsum.photos/seed/example/400/200)
![The same image, stretched horizontally](https://picsum.photos/seed/example/400/100)

Avoid stretching or distorting images, as in the lower example above.

![Low-contrast image with overlay text](https://picsum.photos/300/100?grayscale)

Avoid placing text on low-contrast images—it is hard to read.

![Blurry, low-resolution sample](https://picsum.photos/100/50?blur=5)

Avoid using blurry or low-quality images, which reduce professionalism.

![Unrelated or generic stock photo example](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506744038136-46273834b3fb?fit=crop&w=400&q=20)

Avoid images that do not relate to your content or brand, even if visually appealing.

### Optimization

- Compress images before upload to balance quality and performance.
- Use tools like [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/), [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/), or [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).
- Remove unnecessary metadata to reduce file size.
