## Typography Guidelines

Typography is a core component of effective interface design. Well-crafted typographic systems help establish hierarchy, clarity, recognition, and accessibility across all digital products. The following guidelines ensure typography remains consistent, readable, and accessible in all applications.

### 1. Use System Fonts

- Always use the platform’s core typefaces and approved font stacks to maintain brand consistency.
- Avoid introducing new fonts without design approval.

### 2. Hierarchy & Scale

- Use the established type scale to create visual hierarchy (e.g., headings, body, captions).
- Never alter font sizes outside the design system’s predefined tokens without explicit guidance.

### 3. Weights & Styles

- Apply font weights purposefully (e.g., bold for emphasis, regular for body).
- Avoid using italics or underlining except for denoting special cases (e.g., citations, links).
- Don’t use more than two weights on a single page to avoid visual clutter.

### 4. Line Length & Spacing

- Optimal line length for body copy is 50–75 characters per line.
- Maintain consistent line-height (generally 1.4–1.6 times font size).
- Use design system spacing tokens for vertical spacing between text elements.

### 5. Alignment

- Text should be left-aligned for most Western languages to support readability.
- Avoid center- or right-aligning large blocks of text.

### 6. Color & Contrast

- Always use text color tokens to ensure consistency and support theming.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast between text and background. Aim for WCAG AA:  
  - Normal text: 4.5:1  
  - Large text (18pt/24px and up): 3:1

### 7. Responsive & Adaptive Typography

- Ensure text resizes and wraps properly across breakpoints and devices.
- Avoid fixed sizes or hardcoded units—prefer relative units (e.g., rem, em).

### 8. Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements for headings, lists, etc. (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`).
- Avoid using text as images.
- Never rely solely on typography (such as color or weight) to convey meaning—support with labels or icons.
