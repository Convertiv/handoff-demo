### Logo Variations

- **Primary Logo:** The preferred version for all communications.
- **Monochrome Logo:** Use only when full color is not possible (e.g., limited color printing, or on dark backgrounds).
- **Icon/Mark:** Only use the logomark by itself for app icons, favicons, or where space is highly limited.

### Clear Space & Minimum Size

- Keep sufficient clear space around the logo. The minimum clear space should be the height of the “H” in the logo on all sides.
- Minimum display size:
  - Digital: 32px height
  - Print: 8mm height

### Do’s

- Use only approved and provided logo files—never re-create or alter the logo.
- Ensure good contrast between the logo and background for visibility.
- Center or left-align the logo in layouts as appropriate per context.

### Don'ts

- **Don’t** modify colors, proportions, or orientation of the logo.
- **Don’t** add shadows, outlines, or other effects to the logo.
- **Don’t** place the logo on visually busy or low-contrast backgrounds.
- **Don’t** use the logo as a repeating pattern or decorative element.

### Background Control

- On white or light backgrounds use the primary logo.
- For dark or colored backgrounds, use the white monochrome version for optimal visibility.
