## Sourcing Images

All images used in your designs should be high-quality, properly licensed, and relevant to your project's context. Whenever possible, source images from approved internal libraries or trusted stock providers to ensure proper usage rights and consistency.

### Placeholder Images

When production imagery is not yet available, you can use placeholder images to maintain layout and visual balance during the design and development process:

![Placeholder 1](https://picsum.photos/400/200)
![Placeholder 2](https://placehold.co/300x180)
![User Avatar Placeholder](https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/1.jpg)

_Note: Replace all placeholder images with final assets prior to launch._

### Approved Image Sources

Whenever possible, source images from the official corporate Digital Asset Management (DAM) system. The DAM contains approved and rights-cleared photography, illustrations, logos, and branded assets aligned with our visual standards. Search or browse the DAM to find:

- Brand photography and curated imagery collections
- Official logos and iconography (available in multiple file types)
- Product and UI screenshots
- Licensed illustration sets and graphics
- Historical and event imagery

If the DAM does not contain what you need, secondary sources may include:

- Pre-approved stock imagery libraries (ensure you have the correct usage rights)
- Commissioned original artwork by our creative team or trusted partners

Always avoid using random internet images or unlicensed assets. When in doubt about image permissions or sourcing, contact the design or brand management team for guidance.
