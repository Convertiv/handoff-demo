The Handoff Design System is tightly integrated with the HubSpot CMS. This means that any updates or changes made to the design system here are automatically deployed to a HubSpot parent theme. As a result, the latest components, styles, and guidelines are always reflected on your HubSpot-powered sites without requiring manual intervention.

This seamless integration ensures:

- **Consistency**: Brand standards, design tokens, and UI components stay up-to-date across all HubSpot pages using the theme.
- **Efficiency**: Design and development teams can focus on improving and updating the system, knowing changes will propagate automatically to HubSpot.
- **Reliability**: The automatic deployment process streamlines updates and reduces the risk of outdated themes or assets.

For details on customizing or deploying HubSpot themes with Handoff, see the [Hubspot Integration Guide](/guidelines/hubspot).
