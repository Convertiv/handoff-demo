## SEO Best Practices

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a set of techniques that help your website rank higher in search engine results and become more discoverable to users. Following solid SEO practices ensures that your content is accessible, relevant, and valuable to both users and search engines.

### Top Recommendations

- **Write Unique, Descriptive Titles:** Each page should have a unique `<title>` tag that accurately describes its content.
- **Craft Compelling Meta Descriptions:** Add `<meta name="description">` tags with concise summaries. These can be shown in search results and help increase click-through rates.
- **Use Heading Tags Properly:** Structure content with semantic heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) for clarity and accessibility.
- **Optimize URL Structure:** Keep URLs short, meaningful, and include relevant keywords. Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words.
- **Add Alt Text to Images:** All images should have descriptive `alt` attributes for accessibility and SEO.
- **Use Internal Linking:** Link to related content within your site to help users and crawlers navigate.
- **Publish High-Quality Content:** Focus on valuable, informative, and original content that answers users’ needs.
- **Improve Page Speed:** Fast-loading pages improve user experience and are favored by search engines.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Ensure your site works flawlessly on mobile devices.
- **Use Structured Data:** Implement [schema.org](https://schema.org/) markup to enhance search result listings with rich snippets.

### Technical Tips

- Submit an XML sitemap to search engines.
- Generate a `robots.txt` file to control crawler access.
- Use canonical tags to avoid duplicate content.
- Monitor performance with tools like [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about).
